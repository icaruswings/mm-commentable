= mm-commentable

A simple MongoMapper plugin to make adding comments to your models easy


== Usage

Install the gem
  
    gem install mm-commentable


Or add it to your Gemfile

    gem 'mm-commentable'
  
  
Then add the commentable plugin to you MongoMapper::Document

    class Post
      include MongoMapper::Document
      plugin MongoMapper::Plugins::Commentable

      def on_add_comment(comment)
        do something when a comment is added...
      end
    end
    
You must implement the on_add_comment callback! - however it can be an empty implementation
  
    @post = Post.create
    @commentor = User.create
  
    @post.add_comment("great post..", @user)
  
    @post.comments_count = 1
    @posts.comments = [<Comment>]

* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
